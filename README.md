# Cowboystyle

This is the SCSS source and toolkit for the CSS used in r/UCSantabarbara. This
is only to be used within your own test subreddits by creating your own little
configuration files and passing it as the second argument. For production
deployment, [cowboybeepbot](https://github.com/crazysim/cowboybeepbot) is used.

## CSS

This is generated by Compass through a rakefile. A Guardfile is available for
those who like to have their generated CSS automatically uploaded. It can also
automatically upload generated CSS files to a test reddit. 

## Images

This must be manually uploaded until the python API allows image uploading.
Only finalized versions are to be put in here. Development of these images
happen in a Dropbox folder.

## Random Notes
Modded Official logo from http://satedproductions.com/tmp/reddit/alien/
Export at 144dpi to make it work for Retina displays.
Retina fails on header background image for some reason.
