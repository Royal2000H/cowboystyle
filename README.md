This is the SCSS source and toolkit for the CSS used in r/UCSantabarbara.

## CSS

This is generated by Compass through a rakefile. A Guardfile is avaialbe for
those who don't feel like refreshing manually. It can also automatically upload
generated CSS files to a test reddit. I need to figure out a good color scheme.
I will cite my sources as needed inside the SCSS file.

## Images
This must be manually uploaded until the python API allows image uploading.

Storke tower is on the left and it is pixel art. It has longcat feet for its
bottom. 

The sidebar is like the parking lot signs since the colors fit in just fine. 

A script generates night versions.

## Random Notes
Modded Official logo from http://satedproductions.com/tmp/reddit/alien/
Export at 144dpi to make it work for Retina displays.
Retina fails on header background image for some reason.
