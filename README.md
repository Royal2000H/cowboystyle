This is a Proposed UCSB Reddit CSS theme and scheme generator framework and bot.

I'm just improvising through.

## CSS

This is generated by Compass through a rakefile. A Guardfile is avaialbe for
those who don't feel like refreshing manually. It can also automatically upload
generated CSS files to a test reddit.

## Images
This must be manually done until the python API allows image uploading.

Storke tower is on the left and it is pixel art. It has longcat feet for its
bottom. 

The sidebar is like the parking lot signs since the colors fit in just fine. 

A script generates night versions. The night version of storke tower has
blinking APNG lights.

## Bot

This bot switches between night and day versions. It calculates the altitude of
the sun at the campus and switches to night once the sun is below horizon or to
day once just below horizon. This shouldn't use any external services and
should be pretty optional.
