As for this stylesheet/design itself, 

u/bboe and u/mellort for the Python Reddit API Wrapper for which this project would not
have gotten any sort of near-instant feedback on ongoing designs without.

u/snifty for the logo

u/crazysim for the base SCSS, tower pixel art, concept, and Heroku
compatibility, deployment script, and Rakefiles

u/beetling for feedback on sidebar buttons.

Storke Tower:

Clark and Morgan, which I think is an architectural firm of some sort that
built Storke Tower in the first place. Without the tower, finding some sort of
landmark to draw would be quite a bit harder.
